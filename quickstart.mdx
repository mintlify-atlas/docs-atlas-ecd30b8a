## First Launch

When you first launch nvim-luffy, lazy.nvim will automatically install all plugins. This process happens automatically and takes about 30-60 seconds depending on your internet connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch Neovim">
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    nvim
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for Plugin Installation">
    Lazy.nvim will automatically download and install all plugins. You'll see a progress window showing the installation status.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart Neovim">
    Once installation completes, restart Neovim to ensure all plugins are loaded correctly:
    ```bash
    :q
    nvim
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The leader key is set to **Space** - you'll use it for most keybindings throughout nvim-luffy.
</Note>

## Essential Keybindings

Here are the most important keybindings to get you started. All commands use `Space` as the leader key.

### Finding Files with Telescope

Telescope is your primary tool for navigating files and searching content.

| Keybinding | Action | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `<leader><leader>` | Find Files | Fuzzy find files in current directory |
| `<leader>/` | Live Grep | Search for text across all files |
| `<leader>fr` | Recent Files | Browse recently opened files |
| `<leader>fc` | Find String Under Cursor | Search for the word under your cursor |
| `<leader>ft` | Find TODOs | List all TODO comments in your project |
| `<leader>fk` | Find Keymaps | Search all available keybindings |

<Tip>
Within Telescope, use `Ctrl+k` and `Ctrl+j` to move between results, and `Ctrl+q` to send selected items to the quickfix list.
</Tip>

### Quick Navigation with Harpoon

Harpoon lets you mark files and jump between them instantly - perfect for working with multiple files.

| Keybinding | Action | Reference |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| `<leader>H` | Add File | Mark current file in Harpoon |
| `<leader>h` | Quick Menu | Open Harpoon file menu |
| `<leader>1` to `<leader>9` | Jump to File | Jump directly to marked file 1-9 |

<Tip>
Mark your most-used files with `<leader>H`, then jump between them instantly with `<leader>1`, `<leader>2`, etc.
</Tip>

### File Explorer

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `<leader>e` | Toggle nvim-tree file explorer |

Inside nvim-tree:
- `l` - Open file or expand directory
- `h` - Close directory
- Arrow keys or `j`/`k` - Navigate up/down

### Window & Buffer Management

| Keybinding | Action | Reference |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| `<leader>\|` | Split Vertically | Split current window vertically |
| `<leader>sh` | Split Horizontally | Split current window horizontally |
| `<leader>bd` | Close Buffer | Close current buffer |
| `<leader>ba` | Close All Buffers | Close all open buffers |

### Autocompletion

While in Insert mode, nvim-cmp provides intelligent autocompletion:

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Space` | Trigger completion menu |
| `Ctrl+k` | Select previous suggestion |
| `Ctrl+j` | Select next suggestion |
| `Ctrl+e` | Close completion menu |
| `Enter` | Confirm selection |
| `Tab` | Select next item or expand snippet |

## Your First Workflow

Let's put it all together with a practical example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Project">
    Navigate to your project directory and launch nvim:
    ```bash
    cd ~/my-project
    nvim
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Find a File">
    Press `Space` then `Space` again to open Telescope file finder. Start typing the filename and press `Enter` to open it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Mark Important Files">
    Open 2-3 files you'll work with frequently. For each one, press `Space+Shift+H` to mark it with Harpoon.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Jump Between Files">
    Now press `Space+1` to jump to your first marked file, `Space+2` for the second, etc. No more fuzzy finding!
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Search Your Codebase">
    Press `Space+/` to search for text across all files. Try searching for a function name or variable.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open File Explorer">
    Press `Space+e` to toggle the file tree. Use `h` and `l` to collapse/expand directories, and navigate with `j`/`k`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pro Tips

<Tip>
Press `Space+fk` to search all available keybindings - this is the fastest way to discover new features!
</Tip>

<Tip>
Use `Space+ft` to find all TODO, FIXME, and NOTE comments in your project. Great for tracking work items!
</Tip>

<Tip>
The configuration uses relative line numbers by default. This makes it easy to use motion commands like `10j` to jump 10 lines down.
