# Keymaps

This page documents the core keybindings configured in `lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua`. These are global keymaps that work across all buffers.

<Note>
Plugin-specific keymaps are documented in their respective plugin pages. This page only covers core keymaps.
</Note>

## Leader Key

The leader key is mapped to **Space**:

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = " "
```

Press Space followed by other keys to trigger leader-based commands. The leader key is used throughout the configuration as a prefix for custom shortcuts.

## Window Management

<Accordion title="Split Windows">
Create new window splits:

| Keymap | Mode | Action | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `<leader>\|` | Normal | `<C-w>v` | Split window vertically |
| `<leader>sh` | Normal | `<C-w>s` | Split window horizontally |

```lua title="lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua"
keymap.set("n", "<leader>|", "<C-w>v", { desc = "Split window vertically" })
keymap.set("n", "<leader>sh", "<C-w>s", { desc = "Split window horizontally" })
```

### Usage
- Press `Space` + `|` to create a vertical split (side by side)
- Press `Space` + `s` + `h` to create a horizontal split (top and bottom)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Navigate Between Windows">
To move between windows, use Neovim's built-in commands:

| Keymap | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `<C-w>h` | Move to left window |
| `<C-w>j` | Move to window below |
| `<C-w>k` | Move to window above |
| `<C-w>l` | Move to right window |
| `<C-w>w` | Cycle through windows |

These are Neovim defaults and work out of the box.
</Accordion>

## Buffer Management

<Accordion title="Close Buffers">
Manage open buffers:

| Keymap | Mode | Action | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `<leader>bd` | Normal | `:bd` | Close current buffer |
| `<leader>ba` | Normal | `:%bd` | Close all buffers |

```lua title="lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua"
keymap.set("n", "<leader>bd", "<cmd>bd<CR>", { desc = "Close buffer" })
keymap.set("n", "<leader>ba", "<cmd>%bd<CR>", { desc = "Close all buffers" })
```

### Usage
- Press `Space` + `b` + `d` to close the current buffer
- Press `Space` + `b` + `a` to close all open buffers

<Warning>
Closing all buffers with `<leader>ba` will close every open buffer in your session. Use with caution.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

## Disabled Keymaps

Some keymaps are commented out in the configuration but documented here for reference:

<Accordion title="Insert Mode Escape (Disabled)">
```lua
-- keymap.set("i", "jk", "<ESC>", {desc = "Exit Insert mode with jk"})
```

This keymap would allow pressing `j` followed quickly by `k` in insert mode to escape to normal mode. It's commented out by default but can be enabled if desired.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Clear Search Highlights (Disabled)">
```lua
-- keymap.set("n", "<leader>nh", ":nohl<CR>", { desc = "Clear search highlights" })
```

This keymap would manually clear search highlights. It's disabled because nvim-luffy automatically clears search highlights when the cursor moves (see [Autocommands](/configuration/autocommands)).
</Accordion>

## Adding Custom Keymaps

To add your own keybindings, edit `lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua`:

```lua title="lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua"
local keymap = vim.keymap

-- Add your custom keymaps
keymap.set("n", "<leader>w", "<cmd>w<CR>", { desc = "Save file" })
keymap.set("n", "<leader>q", "<cmd>q<CR>", { desc = "Quit" })
keymap.set("v", "<leader>y", '"+y', { desc = "Copy to system clipboard" })
```

### Keymap Structure

The `vim.keymap.set()` function takes these parameters:

1. **Mode** - The mode where the keymap is active:
   - `"n"` - Normal mode
   - `"i"` - Insert mode
   - `"v"` - Visual mode
   - `"x"` - Visual block mode
   - `"t"` - Terminal mode

2. **Key sequence** - The keys to press (e.g., `"<leader>w"`)

3. **Action** - The command or key sequence to execute

4. **Options** - Table with additional options:
   - `desc` - Description shown in which-key or help
   - `silent` - Don't show command in command line
   - `noremap` - Don't use recursive mapping (default true)

## Plugin Keymaps

Many plugins add their own keybindings. Check the plugin documentation pages:

- [Telescope](/reference/telescope) - Fuzzy finder keymaps
- [nvim-tree](/reference/nvim-tree) - File explorer keymaps
- [LSP](/reference/lsp) - Language server keymaps
- And more in the [Plugins](/plugins/overview) section
